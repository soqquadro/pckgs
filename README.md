# pckgs

#### _A lost attempt to get a job at Canonical_

__pckgs__ is supposed to be python script that runs via command line which, based on the HW architecture specified, is able to pull the latest list of packages made available by Debian in its repository. 

The guy who was delegated by the hiring manager at Canonical said it did not run but managed to create a nameplace for the file... too bad.

I tested it on Windows 10, Mac OS X and Linux Mint (on Virtual Box).

I discovered that a major problem that my script faces is the network config of the hosting machine.

I didn't dedicate any time to fix it because I was kicked out of the selection procedure right away, and rightly so I must add.
